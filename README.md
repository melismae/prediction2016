#### To run in dev mode, use separate terminal windows
```
$ npm run dev-server
$ npm run server
```

The first command runs the Webpack Dev Server on port 8080.

The second command runs nodemon on port 3000.

This way, you can take full advantage of a hot reloading dev server *and* a reloading node server.

#### Production build
```
$ npm run build
```
Builds the static assets.
#### Production server
```
$ npm run start
```
Starts the node server on port 8008.
